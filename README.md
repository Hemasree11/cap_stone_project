# cap_stone_project

This repository consists of my work as a part of capstone project done under the course named Data science and Machine Learning Capstone Project from IBM.

The aim is to find out whether the first phase of a rocket launch will be reused or discarded after the rocket launch, using a machine learning algorithm and also calculate the costs effectively.
